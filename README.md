# Voice Recorder
Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language that has numerous applications across various domains; One of them is creating a voice recorder. We'll make use of  python’s [sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.6/) module for recording and playing audio, together with the [wavio](https://pypi.org/project/wavio/) or the [scipy](https://scipy.org/) module which enables saving the recorded audio.

## Installations

* sounddevice: This module provides functions for recording and playing NumPy arrays containing audio signals. Install by running commapip3 install sounddevice.
  You can use either wavio and scipy to save the recorded audio in file format.

To install wavio, run:

```pip install wavio```

To install scipy, run:

```pip install scipy```

Now, let’s write the code.

## Getting Started

First, import the required libraries.
